# ICAD

In the context of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), it can be beneficial to identify large vessel occlusions caused by intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) prior to endovascular treatment. ICADs, which account for around 3.3% of all large vessel occlusions (considering only treated LVOs in TICA, M1 or M2), are associated to worse reperfusion success. In contrast with other types of occlusions (such as cardioembolic), it may be better to implant an intracranial stent in the stenoted region of the occlusion after a first pass is made, rather than continue attempting thrombectomy passes with all associated risks. 

In this repository, we will build a framework to perform ICAD classification based on multimodal inputs, including imaging data (NCCT and CTA) and relevant clinical data available before starting the procedure.
